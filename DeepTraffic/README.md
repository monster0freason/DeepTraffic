# üö¶ TrafficIntello: Smart Traffic Management System

## üåê Overview

The **Smart Traffic Management System** is an AI-powered, cloud-based solution designed to revolutionize traffic management in modern cities. By analyzing real-time data from **CCTV cameras**, **GPS devices**, and other IoT sensors, the system predicts traffic congestion, controls signals intelligently, and ensures smooth traffic flow, prioritizing emergency vehicles like ambulances. It also provides dynamic routing suggestions and alerts for accidents, all while being controlled from a centralized admin dashboard. Think of it as your city‚Äôs traffic conductor‚Äîkeeping everything moving in perfect harmony!

## üéØ Features

- **AI-Powered Traffic Prediction**: Real-time monitoring of traffic density using machine learning models from CCTV and GPS data.
- **Dynamic Signal Control**: Automatically adjusts traffic signals to optimize vehicle flow at busy junctions.
- **Emergency Vehicle Prioritization**: Detects ambulances and emergency vehicles using an ML model and overrides traffic signals for a clear path.
- **Accident Detection & Alerts**: Detects accidents in real-time and sends instant notifications to drivers and authorities.
- **Centralized Dashboard**: A sleek, modern dashboard for traffic administrators to monitor city-wide traffic conditions, review analytics, and manage incidents.
- **Routing Feedback**: Provides drivers with real-time alternative routes to avoid congestion.
- **Scalable Cloud Deployment**: Hosted on the cloud, allowing seamless data processing, storage, and scalability for large cities.
- **Map Integration**: Interactive city map displaying traffic density, signal status, and emergency alerts at major junctions.
- **Traffic Adjustment Factor**:  An ML model calculates a traffic **adjustment factor** based on multiple factors,used to fine-tune traffic light timings and reroute suggestions for optimized traffic flow.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Traffic Data Ingestion**:  
   The system collects data from multiple sources like CCTV cameras placed at major traffic junctions and GPS in vehicles .

2. **AI Model Prediction**:  
   The AI model analyzes video feeds from CCTV cameras to calculate vehicle density in each lane. It detects emergency vehicles and accidents, triggering automated actions when necessary.

3. **Dynamic Signal Management**:  
   The system then adjusts traffic lights based on real-time density to optimize traffic flow. For example, if an ambulance is detected, it prioritizes the ambulance's lane by turning all other lanes red.

4. **Dashboard Visualization**:  
   Administrators monitor live traffic data through a centralized dashboard. They can view CCTV footage, traffic density, and analytics for different city zones, while drivers receive real-time alerts and routing feedback.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use

- **View Traffic on Map**:  
  The homepage will display a **map of Delhi** with different traffic junctions. Each junction will be color-coded based on traffic density (green for light, yellow for moderate, red for heavy). Simply click on a junction to see live CCTV footage and traffic signal status.

- **Ambulance Override**:  
  If an ambulance is detected in any lane, the system will automatically prioritize its route by turning all other lanes red, and the selected lane green.

- **Dashboard for Admins**:  
  Admins can log in to view a comprehensive dashboard, which provides an overview of the city‚Äôs traffic situation, analytics, and active incidents.

- **Accident Detection Alerts**:  
  When an accident is detected, drivers in the affected area will receive real-time notifications via the map interface, and alternative routes will be suggested.

- **Traffic Adjustment Factor**:  
  An ML model calculates a traffic **adjustment factor** based on multiple factors, including:
  - Current traffic counts
  - Weather data
  - Event data (e.g., parades, protests)
  - Historical traffic data  
  This factor is used to fine-tune traffic light timings and reroute suggestions for optimized traffic flow.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Public Transport Integration**:  
  Extending priority override to buses and trams for more efficient public transportation.

- **User Mobile App**:  
  Develop a mobile app for drivers to receive live traffic updates and suggested routes.

- **Global City Expansion**:  
  Scaling the system for more cities with varying traffic complexities.
